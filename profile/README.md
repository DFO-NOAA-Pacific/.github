# DFO-NOAA-Pacific

In response to marine ecosystems experiencing rapid climate-related change and ocean conditions affecting the distribution, productivity, and abundance of marine species and the fisheries that depend on them, Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA Fisheries) established three transboundary working groups focused around climate change and fisheries to better detect, understand, project, and respond to climate-related impacts. This GitHub organization represents a selection of products related to the DFO-NOAA Pacific working group.
